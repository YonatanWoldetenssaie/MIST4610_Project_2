### Project Description
According to the USDA, the U.S. Food Imports dataset provides an annual summary of the value and volume of food and beverage imports into the United States. It reflects U.S. consumer preferences for diverse, high-quality, and convenient foods, driven by increasing wealth, ethnic diversity, and demand for tropical and gourmet products. The dataset includes import values by food group, origin, and HS (Harmonized System) codes, with over 20 years of data for tracking long-term trends. Data is sourced from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census.
The columns in the data set represent product categories, import volume, country identifiers, and financial metrics such as inflation. The data types present in the set include both categorical values and numerical values. The dataset is well-rounded, providing a diverse set of attributes that allow for a comprehensive analysis of international food imports. 
We chose to utilize this dataset because of its relevance to understanding economic and supply chain trends, particularly in the current global landscape where food security and international trade are relevant issues. Therefore, insights about this topic are both socially and economically significant for everyone.

### Data Manipulation
In order to prepare the data for analysis, we created relationships between relevant tables for each of our questions.  Before using tableau to visualize the data it was necessary to condense the data since the set was so expansive. We did this by getting rid of redundant data in the excel pivot tables.

### Question 1: What have been the key trends in United States food import values over the past 5 years, and do the trends differ between food types?
Relevance: The purpose of this question is to illustrate shifts in consumer demand since 2019. By analyzing trends across different food types, it reveals patterns in market dynamics, such as increasing reliance on certain products. It also shows which countries have the strongest trade relationships with the United States in regards to certain food.

#### Grains

Over the past five years, the United States has seen consistent, steady growth in its grain imports, with 2022 marking the most significant year increase. This growth is primarily driven by imports from Canada, which saw over a 25% increase compared to 2021. Mexico also plays a key role as a supplier, highlighting the U.S.'s reliance on NATO trade partnerships to meet domestic grain demand. The consistent rise in grain imports reflects one or either factors of increasing U.S. consumption or shifts in agricultural production within the country.

#### Meats

In the meat category, U.S. import trends have followed a bell curve, peaking in 2022 and declining slightly in 2023. While the high levels of trade with Canada and Mexico are expected due to their geographic proximity, a notable share of imports also come from Australia and New Zealand, showcasing the global nature of the meat trade. This contribution from Oceania highlights their reputation for high-quality meat exports. The decline in 2023 could be attributed to changing domestic production levels, shifts in demand, or the influence of trade policies, showcasing the volatility of the meat market compared to other food categories.

#### Dairy
![Screenshot 2024-11-28 212846](https://github.com/SahilPnc/MIST-4610-Project-2/blob/main/Dairy%20Graph.jpg)
Dairy imports have experienced shocking growth, with a 40% increase since 2020, reflecting a surge in U.S. demand for foreign dairy products. Unlike grains and meats, which are dominated by North American trade, dairy imports are sourced from a diverse range of countries, with Italy emerging as the largest single contributor. This diversity indicates a broader global trade network for dairy, driven by consumer preferences for specialty/luxury products and an increasing reliance on international suppliers. The rapid growth in dairy imports since 2020 suggests evolving consumer tastes and changes in supply chain dynamics.


#### Question 1 Conclusion
Overall, U.S. food import patterns over the past five years reveal key trends in consumer demand and trade partnerships. Grains and dairy imports have shown consistent growth, while meat imports have fluctuated, reflecting volatility in that market when stacked up against the other two. North America remains a dominant trading partner for grains and meats, whereas dairy imports highlight a more globalized trade network. These trends underscore the importance of regional and international trade relationships in meeting U.S. food demands and adapting to shifting market dynamics.

### Question 2: Which foods suffered the most from price inflation in 2023? Are they the same foods that experienced inflation in 2022?
Relevance: This question addresses the economic impact of price inflation on U.S. food imports, providing insights into how market conditions, supply chain disruptions, and trade policies may have affected food prices in the past few years. By identifying the foods that fluctuate in price, consumers can better understand the volatility in the food market and its implications for food accessibility.

#### Findings

In 2023, the highest inflation rates were observed in Cocoa and Chocolate, Dairy, and Sugar and Candy. In contrast, foods like Nuts, Vegetable Oils, and Meats, which faced the highest inflation in 2022, saw significant deflation in 2023, suggesting improved market conditions. The shift in inflationary trends highlights the dynamic nature of food import markets, where certain categories recover while others face new challenges. 

#### Question 2 Conclusion
The high inflation rates across most food categories in 2022 can possibly be attributed to the lingering effects of the global pandemic, which disrupted supply chains and increased production costs. By 2023, the market appears to have adjusted, with many categories, such as Vegetable Oils and Fish and Shellfish, seeing price reductions. Notably, the graph and table for 2022 shows no price reductions at all. The information presented in these models show that the market for certain foods have definitely improved in the past year, although the decrease in inflation may not be enough to compensate for the increases in previous years. 

### Project Summary
The significance of the analysis of the U.S food import data over the last five years shows insights into the broader economic realm of food trade with market dynamics and consumer demand. With the inclusion of the unique trends from grains, meat, and dairy, and the values from economic impact of price inflation, the crucial data entails the shifts in consumer demand and the effects of possible economic decisions of made in response to global agriculture trends and pressure. For consumers the data gave insights on anticipating price changes and making informed dietary choices. For corporations and policymakers, provide a structure/ basis for trade agreements and  supply chain strategies to help with current and future U.S food security and economic objectives.
